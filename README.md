# Overview
As COVID-19 is highly infectious, the prevention of this disease is mandatory. The instant diagnosis of this disease is obligatory to stop the infection. The most commonly used procedure for COVID-19 detection is the RT-PCR test. But this process is very time-consuming and as a result, it allows the covid infected persons to spread the infection before they come to know the test result. Here, the method of detecting COVID-19 from CT scan images is used as a replacement for the conventional RT-PCR test. But this alternative method has its demerit too. To diagnose COVID-19 from these CT scan images, the analysis of a radiologist expert is required. So, a deep-learning based method for automatic detection of covid infection from the CT scan images is used.
